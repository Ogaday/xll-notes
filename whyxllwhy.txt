Hi all,

I'm trying to get started with the XLL SDK. I'm still learning C++ and how to use Visual Studio and the examples in the SDK (found here) are aren't working out of the box - or at all as far as I've tried.

Could you help me get a minimal working example of an XLL up and running? I think I'm fine with logic and reading code but I'm struggling to get to grips with the task because there's so much new information in play. My background is in scripting and interpreted languages so I need help with the "Change this menu setting, link this library and it will work".

I've opened the project "EXAMPLE" from the samples in the SDK folder in Visual Studio Professional 2013. I've added the directories containing "XLCALL.H" and "FRAMEWRK.H" to the include path so that they can be included at the top of of EXAMPLE.C *.

However, on building for debug or release there are three errors: firstly the makefile  is looking for a lib called Frmwrk32.lib, which I can't find in the XLL SDK. Where did the makefile come from? Was it in the example project or was it autogenerated? It's also looking for it in $(TARGETLIBDIR) **

Thanks,

Ogaday

* What's with all the capital letters? And how comes the filenames are resolved despite case differences? #include <xlcall.h> seems to find XLCALL.H without any problems which I find a bit strange because normally everything is case sensitive.

** Could someone explain to me the $(VARIABLE) notation? They look like bash variables, which I am much more familiar with. Why is this notation %VARIABLE% not used? And how can I easily evaluate the variables? Do I need to play add something to %PATH%? I can't seem to make the Visual Studio developer tools persist on the command line: I can use them if I run vcvarsall.bat in Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0/VC/, but they don't stick around. Besides, are the $(VARIABLES) idiosyncratic to each project?
